/*Conclusion is we can not write nested method in java
 * 
 * 
 * Java does not support “directly” nested methods. Many functional programming languages 
 * support method within method. But you can achieve nested method functionality in Java 7 
 * or older version by define local classes, class within method so this does compile*/
